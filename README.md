# checkbill-project
The objective of the Smart Market Billing System project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a Billing in market shops and the purpose is to design a system using which one can perform all operations related to billing.

This application will help in accessing the information related to the products available in the shop, adding new products to shop, storing each and every bill record, managing cashiers accounts.

I have also implemented the QR code Scanning facility in which you can capture the QR code of any product in your shop to get details of it.The QR code facility eliminates the work of manual product info filling process
This application is developed using Java swing, awt, event handling with Mysql database.
